In examining the suspect's auth log (explanation/sus_authlog), the file tweet_alarm.sh was rm'ed. Examing the mounted Puppy boot volume, etc/rc.d/rc.network calls /tweet_alarm.sh, which is right when the dangerous activity is presented by the OS, therefore it was concluded that this is the script file executing such behavior. However, this script file was deleted from the mounted system, and we were unable to recover it to properly compute the hash (tried to unsquashfs puppy431/pupsave.2fs -- said it couldn't find a "SQUASHFS superblock", and all the deletion recovery tools included in the document to no avail). Therefore, the hash for an empty document was inlcuded in the answer file.
